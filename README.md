This repository was created to provide an opinionated starting point for your new [Astro](https://astro.build/) projects.

## This Astro template includes:

- [DDEV](https://ddev.com/)
- [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Getting started:
Run `ddev start` in your local repository to start the development environment. This command will automatically install any dependencies, start a dev server, and open the project in your browser. The browser will automatically reload when you make changes to the source code.
